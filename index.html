        <p>I was born in Elmhurst, Illinois to two loving parent Mark and Karen Littlefield. Yes, I am a Juinor. I was a single child for 18 months and then my younger sister Jessica was born,
          in order to support his ever growing family my father enlisted into the United States Army. While he was away at basic training my mother, sister, and I lived with my grandparents in
          Villa Park, Illinois. I attened Preschool and Kindergarden at Ardmore Elementry school located in Villa Park, but then after Kindergarden my life had a dramatic change. My Father was
          stationed in Fort Hood, Texas. My entire family moved to an entirely new state and situation, I became as my parents put it, a very naughty child. Soon I settled down and made friends
          attending both 1st and 2nd grade in texas. While there my younger borother Matthew and youngest sister Nicole were born and our family grew bigger. By the time I was entering 3rd grade
          my father was restationed to Fort Mead, Maryland, I attened yet another elementry school and made a plethera of new friends. I also started participating in community sports like 
          soccer, baseball, and basketball. As I was halfway through 4th grade my father was again restationed, this time to Hawaii. In Hawaii I attened Mokulele on Hickem Airforce Base. We swam
          in the ocean, went to historical sites such as the USS Arizona and many even had a vacation to the Big Island. After finishing 6th grade my father retired from the milliaty and we moved
          back to Illinois to be with our extended family.

        <p>After my father retired we moved back in with my grandparents for a year (my 7th grade year). Many of the friend I had made in Kindergarden remembered me, however much to their dissapointment
          it was hard for me to remember them. I made new friends, as well as connected with some old friends, and life was good. However my parents had found a house in Bartlett, Illinois and after a
          year I once again moved to a new school and location. This time however was different, the normal openess and acceptance I once felt now felt barren and empty people trated me as if I was some
          weirdo that walked in off the street and started taking classes with them. That is when I knew that my life had changed, sure I made a few friends here and there but I was the NEW KID, The interloper.
          I was glad when 8th grade was over and I moved on to high school, however the feeling of isolation and alienation got worse and I stopped attending schhol much to my parents dismay. Adventualy
          my school refusal was so bad that I was placed in a crisis unit for Anxiety and Depression and then moved to a residental program, then a halfway house, and finnaly a theraputic day school.
          My seinor year I was able to return to my high school on the same footing as my peers, however as I attened school it was hard for me to make friends in the last year and feelings of isolation
          were creeping back in so I decided that I would drop out of high school and get my GED.

        <p>After droping out my parent pretty much forced me into the local community college, Elgin Community College (ECC), I did not really know what career path I wanted to presue so, knowing I liked computers,
          I picked Computer Information Science. As I was attending ECC, my grandmother passes away. I needed a change I was becoming stagnet and I was dealing with the grief of my grandmothers passing, so I applied
          to Norther Illinois University and got accepted. The change of pace was refreshing, and I felt much better about life and school. After a while I started to reilize that Computer Information Science was
          not for me, so I applied to Kishwaukee College, a community college in Malta, Illinois, and finsihed an Applied Associates in Computer Information Science with an emphisis on proramming. After reciving
          this degree I moved home and attened College of DuPage, a community college located in Glen Elynn, to see if I could find my path. My father recomened I go Computer Information Technology and look into
          security. When I did I fell in love with the cybersecurity field. I did more and more self driven research and graduated with an Applied Associates in Computer InformationTechnology Cybersecurity and 
          Defense degree from College of DuPage. I was planning on going stright into the work force but with encuragement from my professors, as well as encouragement from a few professors at Illinois Institute of
          Technology, I decided to apply for the Information Technology and Management program with the chance to get a Masters in Cybersecurity and Forensics. Which leads us to the point I am at now, attening a new
          school once again, but having found a career that I want to do and with a bright future ahead.
